# Minecraft Autofilling Chest Command Generator
This project creates a simple UI for generating a long command which, when pasted into a command block which is two blocks below a trapped chest (with a solid block between them), will refill every slot in that trapped chest with a full stack of the specified block every time the trapped chest is opened.
